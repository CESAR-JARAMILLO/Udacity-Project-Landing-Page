## Explanation

The javascript file has the majority of the app's functionality. It creates a nav item for each section on the page.

Each nav item is created with a onclick event that contains a built function that will smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.

The nearTop function is used to add a active class to the section that is in the middle of the viewport, then remove it when it scrolls away.

The HTML file was just adjusted to add another section.

The CSS file was slightly adjusted to make the active section more clear which section is being viewed by adjusting the linear gradiant of the active class.

The CSS was also adjusted for the nav links to be mobile friendly.
